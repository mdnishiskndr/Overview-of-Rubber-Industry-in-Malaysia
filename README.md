Then, the dataset was prepared, joined and transformed into meaningful information and insights using Alteryx Designer. Transformed datasaet was plug into Tableau Desktop to use it in developing multiple charts to highlight patterns and trends in rubber production, consumption, import, export and employment. Various data visualization techniques were utilized to create insightful visualization. The developed charts were consolidated into a comprehensive dashboard for a holistic industry performance overview.
